JUNIT testing
## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code is functional and secure I went through a couple of steps with JUNIT testing which will ensure that the code has no errors and is less likely to encounter security issues such as input validation which will ensure that the code will avoid users from over exceeding inputs with a limit. The steps that had to be taken in order for the outcome to be possible is to check every function that is being used in the software to see if there is error including a logistic error which are harder to find and if the outcomes of the function come as expected the JUNIT test should have a valid testing if not the JUNIT test will come as false.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
## How do I approach designing software?
