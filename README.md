JUNIT testing
## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code is functional and secure I went through a couple of steps with JUNIT testing which will ensure that the code has no errors and is less likely to encounter security issues such as input validation which will certified that the code will avoid users from over exceeding inputs with a limit. The steps that had to be taken in order for the outcome to be possible is to check every function that is being used in the software to see if there is errors including a logistic error which are harder to find and if the outcomes of the function come as expected the JUNIT test should have a valid testing if not the JUNIT test will come as invalid.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To interpret user needs and incoporate them it will most likely be done through a measure of checklisting all the requirements that a system will need in order to accomplish the user's needs and so understanding the requirements is the first step before we can incorperated them in the system. Additionally, once the requirements are being met we test out if the program itself has fully accomplish these requirements with no faulty.

## How do I approach designing software?

approaching desgining software comes with multiple steps that need to be achieved in order to fully have a functional software and to do this we need to take into consideration that we need the requirements through the means of collection and then we desgin the software based on these requirements in order to implemnt them into the software. Futhermore, the software needs to go through steps of security, maintenacne and testing to have a well working software for the user in the end.
